# It used to `cat >` the session .env down to CC_NAME/CC_DIR/CC_FLAGS, silently
# wiping every other CC_* key. CC_DESC and CC_TAGS were lost that way, and
# because re-register is the only path to set flags (the PATCH-flags gap,
# AMUX-3115), the destructive write sat on the happy path. This pins that a
# re-register preserves the keys it does not manage while updating the ones it
# does. CLI-side .env write => no server log could catch a regression; this test
# is the guard.
